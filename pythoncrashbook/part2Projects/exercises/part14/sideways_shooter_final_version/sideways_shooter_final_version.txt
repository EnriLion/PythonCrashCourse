Continue developing Sideways Shooter,
using everything weâ€™ve done in this project. Add a Play button, make the game
speed up at appropriate points, and develop a scoring system. Be sure to
refactor your code as you work, and look for opportunities to customize the
game beyond what was shown in this chapter.
