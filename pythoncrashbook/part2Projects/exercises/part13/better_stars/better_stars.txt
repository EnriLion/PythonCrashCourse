You can make a more realistic star pattern by introducing randomness you placeach star. Recall that you can get a random number like this:

from random import randint
random_number = randint(-10, 10)

This code returns a random integer between -10 and 10. Using your code in Exercise 13-1, adjust each star's position by a random amount
