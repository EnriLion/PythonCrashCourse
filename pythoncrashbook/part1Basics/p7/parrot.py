#How the input() Functions works

# the input)= function pauses your program and waits fo the user to enter some text.

message = input("Tell me something , and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

#Note: Sublime Text and many other editors don't run programs that prompt the user for input. You can use these editors to write programs that prompt for input, but you'll need to run these programs from a terminal.
