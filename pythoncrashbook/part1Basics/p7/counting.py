#Introducing the while loops

#the for loop takes a collection of items and executes the block of code once(if a condition is true)

#The while loop in action

current_number = 1
while current_number <= 5:
    print(current_number)
    current_number += 1

#A progam uses a lot or contain while loops for example, a game needs a while loop to keep running as long as you want to keep playing and so it can stop running as soon as you ask it to quit

#while loop s are quite useful
