##Checking for Inequality

# != -> not

requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
    print("Gold the anchovies!")

#the if stament to examine how to use the inequality operator. We'll store a requested pizza topping in a vaiable and then printing a message int eh person did not order anchovies as the example above

##Numerical Comparisons

#Testing numerical values is pretty strighforward

Age = 18

Under_age = Age == 18

print("\n",Under_age)
