#Identing Unnecessarily

message = 'Hello Pyyhon world!'
    prin(message)

##Aslo we could indentend unnecessarily after loop and whiw will get us a indented error of logic

#for magician in magicians:
# print()
# 
# print('Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!")

##Forgetting the Colon
#magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
#for magician in magicians
# print(magician)
